## transcrypt v2.1.0 (? ? 2020)

This release includes features to make it easier and safer to use transcrypt,
in particular: fix merge of encrypted files with conflicts, preventing
accidental commit of plain text files by incompatible Git tools, and upgrade
easily with `--upgrade`.

### Steps to upgrade

1. Make sure you are running the latest version of _transcrypt_:

   ```
   $ transcrypt --version
   ```

2. Upgrade a repository:

   ```
   $ transcrypt --upgrade
   ```

3. Enable the merge handling fix by adding `merge=crypt` to the end of each
   _transcrypt_ pattern in `.gitattribute`, to look like this:

   ```
   sensitive_file  filter=crypt diff=crypt merge=crypt
   ```

### New features

- Add `--upgrade` command to apply the latest transcrypt scripts in an already
  configured repository without the need to re-apply existing settings.

- Install a Git pre-commit hook to reject accidental commit of unencrypted
  plain text version of sensitive files, which could otherwise happen if a tool
  does not respect the `.gitattribute` filters Transcrypt needs to do its job.

### Fixed

- Fix handling of branch merges with conflicts in encrypted files, which would
  previously leave the user to manually merge files with a mix of encrypted and
  unencrypted content. (#69, #8, #23, #67)

- Remove any cached unencrypted files from Git's object database when
  credentials are removed from a repository with a flush or uninstall, so
  sensitive file data does not remain accessible in a surprising way. (#74)

- Fix handling of sensitive files with non-ASCII file names, such as extended
  Unicode characters. (#78)

- Transcrypt `--version` and `--help` commands now work when run outside a Git
  repository. (#68)

- The `--list` command now works in a repository that has not yet been init-ed.

### Changed

- Add a functional test suite built on [bats-core](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core#installation).
- Apply Continuous Integration: run functional tests with GitHub Actions.
- Fix [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) file config for Markdown files.
- Add [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file to make it easier to find notes about
  project changes (see also Release)

## transcrypt v2.0.0 (20 Jul 2019)

**\*\*\* WARNING: Re-encryption will be required when updating to version 2.0.0! \*\*\***

This is not a security issue, but the result of a [bug fix](https://github.com/elasticdog/transcrypt/pull/57) to ensure that the salt generation is consistent across all operating systems. Once someone on your team updates to version 2.0.0, it will manifest as the encrypted files in your repository showing as _changed_. You should ensure that all users upgrade at the same time...since `transcrypt` itself is small, it may make sense to commit the script directly into your repo to maintain consistency moving forward.

### Steps to Re-encrypt

After you've upgraded to v2.0.0...

1. Display the current config so you can reference the command to re-initialize things:

   ```
   $ transcrypt --display
   The current repository was configured using transcrypt version 1.1.0
   and has the following configuration:

     GIT_WORK_TREE:  /home/elasticdog/src/transcrypt
     GIT_DIR:        /home/elasticdog/src/transcrypt/.git
     GIT_ATTRIBUTES: /home/elasticdog/src/transcrypt/.gitattributes

     CIPHER:   aes-256-cbc
     PASSWORD: correct horse battery staple

   Copy and paste the following command to initialize a cloned repository:

     transcrypt -c aes-256-cbc -p 'correct horse battery staple'
   ```

2. Flush the credentials and re-configure the repo with the same settings as above:

   ```
   $ transcrypt --flush-credentials
   $ transcrypt -c aes-256-cbc -p 'correct horse battery staple'
   ```

3. Now that all of the appropriate files have been re-encrypted, add them and commit the changes:
   ```
   $ git add -- $(transcrypt --list)
   $ git commit --message="Re-encrypt files protected by transcrypt using new salt value"
   ```

### Fixed

- Force the use of macOS's system `sed` binary to prevent errors (#50)
- Fix cross-platform compatibility by making salt generation logic consistent (#57)

### Changed

- Add an [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) file to help with consistency in formatting (#51)
- Use [unofficial Bash strict mode](http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/) for safety (#53)
- Reformat files using the automated formatting tools [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [shfmt](https://github.com/mvdan/sh)
- Ensure that `transcrypt` addresses all [ShellCheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) static analysis warnings

## transcrypt v0.9.9 (5 Sep 2016)

Since the v0.9.7 release, these are the notable improvements made to transcrypt:

- support for use of a [wildcard](https://github.com/elasticdog/transcrypt/commit/a0b7d4ec0296e83974cb02be640747149b23ef54) with `--show-raw` to dump the raw commit objects for _all_ encrypted files
- GPG import/export of repository configuration
- more [strict filter script behavior](https://github.com/elasticdog/transcrypt/pull/29) to adhere to upstream recommendations
- automatic caching of the decrypted content for faster Git operations like `git log -p`
- ability to configure bare repositories
- ability to configure "fake bare" repositories for use through [vcsh](https://github.com/RichiH/vcsh)
- ability configure multiple worktrees via [git-workflow](https://github.com/blog/2042-git-2-5-including-multiple-worktrees-and-triangular-workflows)
- support for unencrypted archive exporting via [git-archive](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-archive)
