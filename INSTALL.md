# Install transcrypt

The requirements to run transcrypt are minimal:

- Bash
- Git
- OpenSSL
- `column` command (on Ubuntu/Debian install `bsdmainutils`)
- if using OpenSSL 3+ one of: `xxd` (on Ubuntu/Debian is included with `vim`)
  or `printf` command (with %b directive) or `perl`

...and optionally:

- GnuPG - for secure configuration import/export

You also need access to the _transcrypt_ script itself...
